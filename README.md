# Network-Traffic-Scenario-Prediction-Challenge-by-ITU

## Description

This repository contains the solution for the Traffic Scenario Classification Challenge organized by Zindi. The objective of the challenge is to predict the traffic scenario for unknown traffic based on training set data. The scenarios are categorized based on traffic performance and characteristics. The challenge is part of AI for Good, organized by ITU in partnership with UN Sister Agencies.

## Challenge Details

- **Organizer:** Zindi
- **Competition Accuracy:** 99%
- **Competition URL:** [Zindi Competition Link]([https://www.zindi.org/competitions/](https://zindi.africa/competitions/network-traffic-scenario-prediction-challenge))
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression

## Solution Approach

The solution notebook for this challenge utilizes logistic regression for traffic scenario classification. Logistic regression is a suitable choice for binary classification tasks, which fits well with the nature of predicting scenarios. The challenge requires predicting the scenario to which unknown traffic belongs. The accuracy achieved by the solution is an impressive 99%.

## Data Visualization

The solution notebook includes several data visualizations to better understand the dataset and the characteristics of different traffic scenarios. Visualization is a crucial step in the data analysis process as it helps in identifying patterns, outliers, and relationships within the data.

## Repository Contents

- `solution_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete solution.
- `data_visualizations.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data visualizations.
- `submission.csv`: CSV file containing model predictions for the test dataset.
- `report.pdf`: Technical report explaining the solution methodology, outcomes, and model details.

## Evaluation

The competition's primary evaluation metric is Accuracy. The solution's accuracy of 99% showcases its effectiveness in predicting traffic scenarios accurately. Both the quality of the technical report and the achieved model score will be considered during the final evaluation.

## Prizes

The competition offers attractive prizes for top performers:
- 1st Place: $500 USD
- 2nd Place: $300 USD
- 3rd Place: $200 USD

Additionally, there are 3,000 Zindi points available for participants.
